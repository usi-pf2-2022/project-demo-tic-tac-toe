## Project Structure

This project is both a Maven project and a BlueJ project.
You can open, compile, test, and run the code within BlueJ
by opening `src/package.bluej`.

You can use Maven to compile, test, and check the code
by running `mvn` in this top-level directory (see below).

You can run the code compiled by Maven from the terminal (see below).

The code is structured into three packages:

* `model` - all the model classes and their tests
* `tui` - text user interface (works in a terminal)
* `gui` - Swing-based graphical user interface (opens a window)

Note that the classes in the `model` package MUST NOT refer to any
classes in the `tui` or `gui` packages.

The classes in the `tui` package must not refer to any classes in the `gui` package.

The classes in the `gui` package must not refer to any classes in the `tui` package.

The classes in the `tui` and `gui` packages SHOULD refer to classes in the `model` package.

The classes in the `model` package need to come with unit tests.
(The classes in the `tui` and `gui` packages do not need to be covered with tests.)

## How build using Maven

In this top-level directory:

```bash
mvn compile
```

## How to run the application

To run the application from outside BlueJ, first build it with Maven.
This generates the compiled classes in the directory `target/classes`.

### Running the TUI

To run this application, with the TUI, from the command line:

```bash
java -cp target/classes tui.Main ARG ARG ARG
```

DESCRIPTION OF COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

### Running the GUI

To run this application, with the GUI, from the command line:

```bash
java -cp target/classes gui.Main ARG ARG ARG
```

DESCRIPTION OF COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

### How run the JUnit tests with Maven

```bash
mvn test
```

### How to run Checkstyle with Maven

```bash
mvn compile
mvn checkstyle:check
```

### How to run PMD with Maven

```bash
mvn compile
mvn pmd:check
```

### How to run PMD's CPD with Maven

```bash
mvn compile
mvn pmd:cpd-check
```

### How to determine test coverage with Maven

```bash
mvn site
```

Then open `target/site/index.html` and find the JaCoCo report.
